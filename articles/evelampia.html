                    <p>
                        In early 2025, I was approached by my mother. She is an
                        artist who draws oil paintings for a living, and she
                        asked me to create thank-you cards to include with her
                        paintings. What started as a small request turned into a
                        larger project.
                        <br />
                        Over the next half year, I cooperated with her to build
                        a more defined visual system around her work. We
                        discussed what she wanted to communicate to her buyers,
                        explored different directions, and tested several ideas
                        together. The goal was to create something that felt
                        personal to her, but also consistent and clear. During
                        this process, I worked on layouts, selected type, and
                        introduced small graphic elements that matched the tone
                        of her paintings. She contributed sketches and rough
                        concepts, and we combined both approaches into a simple
                        system that she could use for her cards and other small
                        printed materials. By the end, we arrived at a set of
                        thank-you cards and a basic visual identity that felt
                        natural to her style and helped present her work in a
                        more intentional way.
